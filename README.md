# The No-OP AI

This OpenTTD AI does … nothing.

## Why?

Single-player OpenTTD doesn't let you create a second company unless it has
an AI attached.

If you want to switch companies – perhaps to test different strategies, or
just because the Mountains of Doom should be served by vehicles in another
livery than those that coast through your map's Plains of Desperation, you
need a placeholder that doesn't otherwise interfere.

This is one.
